# 🕹️ Hole and Mole Game

A fun and interactive browser-based "Hole and Mole" game inspired by the classic Whac-A-Mole! Smash the moles as they pop up from the holes to earn points — but beware, they get faster and trickier with each level!

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Score System**: Keep track of your hits and misses to see how well you're doing!
- 🐹 **Dynamic Mole Movement**: Moles appear randomly in different holes and move faster as the game progresses.
- 🎮 **Three Difficulty Levels**:
  - **Easy**: Slower mole movement, more time to react.
  - **Medium**: A balance of speed and challenge.
  - **Hard**: Fast-paced action for experienced players!

1. Choose a difficulty level to start the game.
2. Moles will pop up randomly from the holes.
